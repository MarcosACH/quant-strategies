# Quantitative Trading Strategy Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines a comprehensive workflow for developing robust quantitative trading strategies while adhering to data science best practices and avoiding overfitting. The process is divided into five distinct phases, each with specific objectives and validation checkpoints.

---

## Phase 1: Research & Development

### 1. Strategy Idea & Hypothesis

**Task**: Formulate a clear, testable trading hypothesis based on market observations or academic research.

**Key Activities**:

- Define the market inefficiency you're trying to exploit
- Establish clear success criteria and expected behavior
- Document the theoretical foundation and market logic

**Important Considerations**:

- Hypothesis should be specific and measurable
- Consider market microstructure and regime changes
- Ensure the edge is economically meaningful after costs

**Scenarios**:

- **Good**: "RSI divergence in low-volatility periods predicts mean reversion"
- **Poor**: "Technical indicators will predict price movements"

### 2. Data Collection & Preparation

**Task**: Gather, clean, and structure all necessary market data with proper quality controls.

**Key Activities**:

- Collect price, volume, and fundamental data
- Handle missing data, outliers, and corporate actions
- Implement data quality checks and validation rules
- Create data pipelines for ongoing updates

**Important Considerations**:

- Survivorship bias elimination
- Look-ahead bias prevention
- Point-in-time data integrity
- Sufficient data history for statistical significance

**Scenarios**:

- **Critical**: Ensure dividend adjustments are properly handled
- **Warning**: Missing data during market stress periods
- **Error**: Using restated fundamentals with historical prices

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Task**: Understand data characteristics, distributions, and relationships that will inform strategy development.

**Key Activities**:

- Analyze price and volume patterns
- Examine correlation structures and regime changes
- Identify seasonality and calendar effects
- Assess data quality and completeness

**Important Considerations**:

- Market regime identification
